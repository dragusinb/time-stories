# Project Notes for Claude

## Image Generation Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: All images should be in PIXEL ART style**

When generating images for the Apollo story (or any story), use pixel art style:
- "16-bit pixel art style" or "retro pixel art"
- Limited color palette
- Blocky/pixelated appearance
- Game-like aesthetic
- NO realistic photography style
- NO photorealistic renders

Example prompt structure:
```
16-bit pixel art style, [scene description], limited color palette, retro game aesthetic, no text
```

## Story Themes

- **Apollo (Story 1)**: 1969 Moon landing, historically accurate
- **Alchemist (Story 2)**: Medieval Prague, alchemy, mystery
- **Archimedes (Story 3)**: Ancient Syracuse, Greek mathematician

## Minigame Types

Each story uses various minigames. Ensure theme prop is passed correctly to minigame components.
